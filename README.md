# Secure Contract Interaction (SCI) Metamask Snap

## Description

We aim to bolster security measures within the web3 ecosystem by establishing an on-chain registry that allows owners to verify which smart contracts should be allowed to interact with their web domains.

SCIâ€™s purpose is to verify that websites are interacting with validated and authorized smart contracts minimizing user risks and exploits.

With this snap you will be able to review if the domain has authorized the contract for each Metamask transaction.
